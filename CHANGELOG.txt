2.5.30 - 16th May 2021
- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.
- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.
- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').
- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.
- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.
- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.
- Known issue: Turning in quests automatically causes a harmless error to be shown in chat.
- Known issue: Disabe screen glow and disable special effects cannot be added yet as ffxGlow, ffxDeath and ffxNetherWorld are not currently in the game.
- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.
