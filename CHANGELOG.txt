2.5.34 - 23rd May 2021
- Maintenance update.

2.5.33 - 21st May 2021
- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.
- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.
- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.

2.5.32 - 17th May 2021
- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.
- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.
- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').
- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.
- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.
- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.
- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.
